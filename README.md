# Factorizer

This program asks the user for the number they want to find the factors for.
The program prints out the original number chosen by the user and all the factors for that number.
This program also prints whether the number chosen by the user is a prime number and whether it is a perfect number. 

- A perfect number is defined as a number where all the factors of the number, excluding the number itself, add up to that number.
- A prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has only itself and 1 as factors.
